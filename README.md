## Overview

Tabula-Rasa is an app that allows users to search for and store quotes, organized by author.

## Learning Goals

- Gain experience with React and React Router
- Practice using APIs and managing state in a React application
- Improve styling skills using CSS and Material UI

## Evolution

The project started with a basic React app structure, and has grown to include functionality for searching, storing, and memorizing quotes. The app has a welcoming home page my only goal was to have the User be greeted with a random quote and the API repo actually had a skeleton and suggestions to do so. The SearchAuthor component was the most complex component of the 3 but I learned the most while building it. Next steps down the line I would like to include a dark mode and music and the ability to search more authors not just the top 20 alphabetically.

## Instructions

To run the application locally, clone the project and run `npm install`, followed by `npm start`.
